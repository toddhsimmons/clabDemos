# 🧠 Toddomation Arista Lab — Containerlab in GitHub Codespaces

Welcome, Nerds! 👋  
This repo is part of the **Toddomation YouTube series** on learning how to build and run **Arista network labs** anywhere — using **GitHub Codespaces** and **Containerlab**.

## 🎬 About This Project

This repository provides a lightweight environment to help you:
- Learn how to use **GitHub Codespaces** as your cloud-based lab platform.
- Set up and run **Arista cEOS** containers inside **Containerlab**.
- Build, test, and experiment with your own **network topologies** — all from a browser, with no local hardware required.

Whether you’re a network engineer, student, or just a curious nerd, this setup lets you **lab from anywhere**.

## ⚙️ Requirements

Before you begin, you’ll need:
- A **GitHub account**
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** installed and authenticated
- **VS Code** (or Codespaces browser environment)
- **Arista cEOS-lab image** (downloaded from [arista.com](https://www.arista.com))

## 📂 Repository Structure
```
/images              → Where you’ll upload your cEOS .tar.xz file
/topologies          → Containerlab topology files (Arista network setups)
/configs             → Device configurations (optional)
/scripts             → Helper scripts and tools
```
---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.  
2. **Create a Codespace** from your forked repo (`Code → Codespaces → Create`).  
3. **Upload your cEOS image** into the `/images` directory.  
4. **Run your topology** using Containerlab.  

> 🧩 Detailed steps are covered in each episode of the YouTube series!

That will render like this on GitHub 👇

**Command to get the cEOS image into `/basicLab/images`:**

```bash
gh codespace cp -e images/cEOS64-lab-4.30.1F.tar.xz 'remote:/workspaces/clabDemos/basicLab/images' -c <codespace_name>
```

### ⚠️ Note: Containerlab VS Code Extension Setup

When you first open this project in **GitHub Codespaces**, you may need to **manually install and trust the Containerlab VS Code extension**.

This happens because the **Containerlab extension is not yet a trusted extension in Codespaces**, so it won’t be installed automatically during the environment setup.

To fix this:

1. In your Codespace, open the **Extensions** panel (⇧⌘X / Ctrl+Shift+X).
2. Search for **Containerlab**.
3. Click **Install**.
4. When prompted, select **“Trust this extension”**.

Once installed and trusted, the extension will integrate with your lab environment automatically on subsequent launches.
