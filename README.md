# 🧠 Toddomation Arista Lab — Containerlab in GitHub Codespaces

Welcome, Nerds! 👋  
This repo is part of the **Toddomation YouTube series** on learning how to build and run **Arista network labs** anywhere — using **GitHub Codespaces** and **Containerlab**.

## 🎬 About This Project

This repository provides a lightweight environment to help you:
- Learn how to use **GitHub Codespaces** as your cloud-based lab platform.
- Set up and run **Arista cEOS** containers inside **Containerlab**.
- Build, test, and experiment with your own **network topologies** — all from a browser, with no local hardware required.

Whether you’re a network engineer, student, or just a curious nerd, this setup lets you **lab from anywhere**.
